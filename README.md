### Currently Building

#### Climate Action Readiness for Educators  
***Applied Data Science / Analytics***

A decision-support dashboard for climate educators that translates public opinion data into actionable classroom strategies.  
Initial delivery focuses on transparent indicators and rules-based recommendations, with narrative generation planned as a later phase.

This project will integrate data science with climate education to support evidence-based action while respecting regional, social, and equity considerations.

**Focus:** public data synthesis, decision support, education + climate impact
