### Abi Kambanis  
***Data Scientist***

I am an applied data scientist with a background in science and education, focused on building interpretable, decision-oriented models that support real-world outcomes.

My work sits at the intersection of data science, education systems, and climate action. I specialize in translating complex data into clear insights that inform strategy and operations, particularly in contexts where human behavior and equity matter.

I am currently preparing for full-time, mid-level data scientist roles in 2026.

#### Climate Action Readiness for Educators  
***Applied Data Science / Analytics***

Developing a decision-support tool that helps climate educators assess local readiness for climate action and select engagement strategies aligned with community context, using public opinion and engagement indicators.

This project integrates data science with climate education to support evidence-based action while respecting regional, social, and equity considerations.

**Focus:** public data synthesis, decision support, education + climate impact

### Currently Building

A decision-support dashboard for climate educators that translates public opinion data into actionable classroom strategies.  
Initial delivery focuses on transparent indicators and rules-based recommendations, with narrative generation planned as a later phase.
