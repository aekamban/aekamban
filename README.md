## Abigail Kambanis  
**Data Scientist**

I am an applied data scientist with a background in science and education, focused on building interpretable, decision-oriented models that support real-world outcomes.

My work sits at the intersection of data science, education systems, and climate action. I specialize in translating complex data into clear insights that inform strategy and operations, particularly in contexts where human behavior and equity matter.

I am currently preparing for full-time, mid-level data scientist roles in 2026.
